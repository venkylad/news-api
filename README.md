# News-app (news-api)
### Note: News-api only gives access to Localhost: 3000, No Other URL can't get access or data, So It can't be deployed on heroku or netlify. we need premeium tier to do that.
### What I used React, News-api, React Context-API(instead of Redux).
### Clone the repo by using command <i>git clone</i>
### After cloning use command <i>npm i</i> to install all dependencies
### Then type <i>npm start</i> start the live server on Localhost:3000
